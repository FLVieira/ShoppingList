This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## For testing in your own system

After that configuration, you are ready to go. Run npm i, and after all the dependencies
install, run npm start on your terminal.

## Observations

This application is based on https://github.com/Walter-Cantori/listacompras.git, here i make
some adjustments to make it be based on React Hooks, both in the React part
itself and in the Redux part.
p.s: I'm deactivating a bunch of eslint rules, feel free to active them all back.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
